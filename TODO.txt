Here should be a TODO list - main targets for future improvements:
1. Prepare a test for measuring performance and accuracy based on 3D damper
model.
2. Prepeare a second test based on 2D arch damper (plain strain state).
3. Prepeare a test for testing axisymmetric elements.
4. Use Eigen algebra library instead of in-house code. Measure performance and
accuracy.
5. Make it possible to use wedges (prismatic elements). And triangles for 2D
case.
6. Develop Tetra elements (4 3D nodes).
7. Make it possible to change an element on the fly (without a recompilation).
8. Make it possible to work with different elements and materials in one
analysis.
9. Add to ans_read_data ability to read material data, components (node,
elements), element type from cdb file.
10. Add material to work with a general hyperelastic energy function W.
11. Add node and element reordering procedure (to improve performance)
12. Use OpenSource large scale linear equation solver (mumps?) insted of /
with addition to Intel MKL.
13. Add more economic format to save analysis results in Paraview format. If
it is possible, implement a real-time piping from nla3d to Paraview while
analysis is running.
